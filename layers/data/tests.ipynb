      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The advent of large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's family of GPT models has created the opportunity for significant disruption across multiple domains driving industry professionals to investigate potential use cases. Given ChatGPT's relatively brief existence (13 months at the time of this writing), research into its capabilities is still in the exploratory stages. The value of an LLM like OpenAI's\n",

      "most recent model GPT-4 is its versatility across domains, allowing it to support a wide range of tasks (Ray, 2023). Applications for GPT have been demonstrated in many industries such as healthcare, business and finance, legal services, content generation, education, programming, sales, banking and more (Ray, 2023). Essentially, the flexibility of GPT affords developers the opportunity to create tailored applications for their needs (Ollivier et al, 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementation of GPT in many fields has faced challenges. Examples can be found in the news of ChatGPT being used clumsily, leading to failures such as erroneous periodical publications and factually incorrect legal arguments (Farhi, 2023; Bohanon, 2023). These failures stem from overreliance on AI, where individuals prompting the AI neglect to review the generated results. Instead of replacing humans, AI tools like GPT should be utilized as assistants or expert advisors, handling challenging or tedious tasks, and providing valuable insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "GPT and other LLMs have been highlighted in many fields, one domain that was not pursued in early reviews of the technology is systems engineering (Ray, 2023). Large Language Models work by learning the broad patterns and relationships that exist within language, enabling them to comprehend the meaning of prompts, sentences, and phrases. LLMs can comprehend complex relationships and draw meaning from that complexity. Given systems engineering's emphasis on managing complexity, LLMs hold great potential to support systems engineering activities and processes. One of particular interest is in the generation of Systems Modeling Language (SysML) conceptual models.\n",
      "\n",
      "While attention has been dedicated to assessing GPT's proficiency in generating syntactically correct programming code (Biswas, 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Sakib et al., 2023), there has been limited exploration of its capacity to develop comprehensive conceptual models and system models. This study is one of the initial endeavors to examine GPT-4's ability to generate SysML conceptual models. This research integrates GPT-4 into enterprise-level SysML modeling software (CATIA Magic) using a newly created tool, AI-Systems Modeling Enhancer (AI-SME). Moreover, this research marks an effort to evaluate GPT's performance in system modeling to that of a human. Rather than replacing systems engineers, this AI-SME tool is envisioned as an intelligent assistant that can help modelers create more complete and accurate SysML models faster than historically possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models, and GPTs\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is defined as 'a field of science and engineering concerned with the computational understanding of what is commonly called intelligent behavior, and with the creation of artifacts that exhibit such behavior (Shapiro, 1992). The focus of this research, LLMs, are a type of AI that have been trained on massive amounts of text data. This training enables the LLM to understand and generate human language and is accomplished through a combination of neural networks and machine learning algorithms. These LLMs allow computers to understand and generate language more quickly and accurately than was previously possible (Ray, 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "The text data, in the form of news articles, books, social media posts, and even Wikipedia, provides the LLM with a body of information that teaches the model patterns and relationships within a language. This understanding of linguistic patterns and relationships enables LLMs to generate natural responses, text, and images.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the most well known example of an LLM is OpenAI's GPT and its accompanying chatbot app, ChatGPT. These Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) stem from Natural Language Processing AI and are built around Transformer Architecture (Ray, 2023). This revolutionary architecture paved the way for a series of OpenAI products GPT-2, GPT-3, and, most recently, GPT-4. With each iteration the number of parameters used for training the model has grown in orders of magnitude, from 1.5 billion parameters\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model-Based Systems Engineering\n",
      "\n",
      "Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) combines the principles and practices of Systems Engineering with Model-Based methods, languages, and tools. Value-added deployments of MBSE generate representations of behavior, structure, or both that communicate accurate information to stakeholders. Regardless of the target of the MBSE analysis, it is imperative that the model is focused in purpose and scope. The application of MBSE may be focused on describing a system of interest, analyzing an element of a system, characterizing a process, simulating impacts of phenomena, or other purposes (DoD, 1998). The models that result from these efforts may represent the entirety of a system or elements of a system or process that bear particular relevance to the task at hand (Freidenthal, et al. 2014). Because MBSE has strong roots in traditional systems engineering, it can be applied broadly and liberally across industries.\n",

      "## Exploring Human-AI Teaming for Systems Modeling\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a growing desire to leverage the collaboration between humans and AI, known as human-AI teaming . Recent developments in AI provide the opportunity for integration into user-facing systems across industries and scales of complexity (Amershi et al, 2019). However, challenges arise from the opacity of deep learning AI models, often termed black boxes due to their inability to explain decision-making processes to human collaborators. This lack of transparency significantly impacts the trust human-users place in their AI counterparts. Increased research in developing collaborative mental models between humans and AI becomes pivotal in fostering effective teamwork and trust (Kaur, 2019).\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhang et. al. investigated AI assistance in multiplayer games, demonstrating humans prioritize specific characteristics in their AI teammates. Skill was deemed the most important aspect humans valued from AI, followed by supportive, proactive, and obedient traits. The human expectations from AI teammates include skill, shared understanding, sophisticated communication for collaboration, and human-like performance (2021). These guidelines can be applied to human-AI teaming in the MBSE domain. If AI can provide these characteristics in a MBSE setting, human-AI teaming will provide a valuable resource for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further investigation into the strengths and weaknesses of both humans and AI is essential. AI excels at drawing inferences from training data and creating structured model relationships with unmatched speed and knowledge. While AI performance can surpass human capabilities in some respects, gaps exist if the training data lacks relevant information associated with the conceptual model (Amershi et al, 2019). The communicative abilities of AI continue to advance, demonstrating a growing responsiveness to human instructions-an aspect highly valued by human modelers. One primary deficit pertains to shared mental models between the human and AI. Despite replicating human-like responses, AI lacks conceptual understanding and intricate mental models, as its neural networks focus on pattern recognition and may not fully capture the complexity of human thought and creative processes (Kaur, 2019).\n",
      "\n",
      "This potential limitation could lead to frustration if the AI consistently misinterprets the human modeler's intent. Consequently, the AI might also generate incorrect modeling elements. In-order to use AI effectively in the modeling process, engineers must have training in prompting and guiding the AI. The AI outputs still need to be edited to ensure they are acceptable designs. By developing a set of parameters, engineers can harness AI and accelerate their process (Yüksel et al, 2023). Fortunately, humans retain the\n",

AI excels in rapid model generation, while humans contribute by editing and adding complex relationships or associations beyond the AI's capability. This collaborative approach maximizes the strengths of both participants in the MBSE domain.\n",

      "## Existing Endeavors in AI and Systems Modeling\n",
      "\n",
      "As AI capability has advanced, researchers made strides in harnessing its power to generate system models. There have been devoted efforts to developing systems that leverage NLP for the automatic generation of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams (Deeptimahanti &amp; Babar, 2009; Gulia &amp; Choudhury, 2016; More &amp; Phalnikar, 2012). These methods have also been extended to SysML models (Chen &amp; Bhada, 2022). In these applications, users input textual descriptions and the algorithms then identify words of significance, such as nouns representing objects and verbs indicating actions. Using these keywords, the algorithm can generate model elements for a UML diagram (Dawood, 2017). It is important to note that the generated models are restricted to the data provided by the user and the effectiveness is reliant on the sophistication of the algorithm. Challenges exist due to the inherent ambiguities of natural language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relatedly, a UML diagram recommender plugin was developed using supervised learning techniques for the open-source modeling tool Eclipse Papyrus. This tool, utilizing around 100,000 models from public repositories, employs algorithms to suggest potential related elements when a specific element name is present in a model. The utilization of a Papyrus plugin allows access to AI data to generate model elements (Savary-Leblanc et al., 2021). While not utilizing generative modeling techniques, this research represents a breakthrough in the integration of AI in widely used modeling software.\n",
      "\n",
      "On November 30, 2022, OpenAI publicly launched the ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer) application. This pretrained model, based on an extensive dataset, excels in natural language processing and generates unique responses without relying on predefined answers. This technology has significantly reduced obstacles for researchers seeking to leverage AI without a specialized background in AI systems. Due to its accessibility, this tool has been adopted across industries. However, currently a limited number of research initiatives are exploring the use of the ChatGPT application and underlying GPT model for generating conceptual and systems models.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one research study, ChatGPT's accuracy was assessed in generating UML models with PlantUML, a tool for creating diagrams from plain text. Results showed ChatGPT is proficient with simple associations, but it encounters difficulties with complex relationships. Although ChatGPT can produce models quickly and efficiently, researchers note that ChatGPT is not yet a reliable tool to perform modeling tasks. However, the study details the promise of ChatGPT being used as a modeling assistant in the future (Cámara et al., 2023). This research lays the foundation for the exploration of AI modeling assistants. Additionally, GPT's integration into enterprise-level modeling software remains an avenue for exploration.\n",
      "\n",
      "This research aims to integrate GPT into CATIA Magic. Using GPT, users can express their modeling objectives in natural language, translating into automatic model element generation. This offers a novel and efficient approach to systems modeling. By harnessing the synergy between advanced AI models and the human modeler, this research opens avenues for enhanced user experience and streamlined workflows.\n",

      "## Integrating ChatGPT into MBSE (AI-SME)\n",
      "\n",
      "CATIA Magic incorporates plugin capability that allows developers to interface with modeling tools programmatically. This enables the automation of repetitive tasks without using the regular point-and-click interface. However, writing code for plugins comes with challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "One significant hurdle is that MBSE involves capturing architecture of complex systems, human decision-making skills, and knowledge of similar existing systems. Trying to implement this human capability into a structured code can be quite challenging. While plugin capability exists for automation, the learning curve for implementation and the difficulties in emulating human modeling behavior through code is less practical for everyday users.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rising popularity of AI, especially in generative AI with natural language processing, leads to an opportunity to address limitations in coding human-like capabilities. Integrating AI into systems modeling software through natural language prompts allows the user to create complex conceptual models harnessing extensive training data, pattern recognition, inference, and contextual understanding. This AI data can be parsed and implemented programmatically using plugin capability, significantly reducing the time and effort required for MBSE tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AI-SME in this research utilizes OpenAI's GPT to allow users to express their modeling objectives in natural language form. The AI-SME takes the user input and translates the GPT response into CATIA Magic using Open Java API plugins.Open AI offers a range of models, each trained differently and boasting incremental enhancements. This research employed the latest model (as of late November 2023), GPT-4 Turbo. Trained on data up to April 2023, this is the most up-to-date model, though it exhibits slower response times and is not currently recommended for production-level traffic. In this specific application, the flexibility provided by the Open Java API plugin enables the integration of GPT to the modeling environment. This synergy allows GPT responses to generate modeling elements with minimal translation programming, offering a powerful tool for modelers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Data Creation Procedure\n",
      "\n",
      "GPT shows significant response variability, with small changes in prompts resulting in distinct differences in generated responses. The inherent non-deterministic nature of the AI system produces diverse responses, making responses unpredictable even with identical prompts. To address this variability of responses, three separate prompts were crafted, each varying in specificity of the desired model output. These prompts were replicated three times, resulting in a total of nine models for assessment. Additionally, the time taken to create each diagram type in the model using the AI-SME was programmatically recorded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prompt sent to GPT consists of two segments. The initial segment is the user input, wherein the user provides instructions for the desired model. Subsequently, the AI-SME appends a second segment to the user input, incorporating a brief message that designates the desired SysML diagram and outlines a structure format for the GPT response. This response format ensures the AI-SME can parse the data from GPT to generate model elements. The existing graphical user interface is displayed in Figure 1, accompanied by an illustrative prompt provided below.\n",

The payload needs to be transported quickly and can sustain an inertial force of up to 30g and transient inertial force of up to 40g. The payload must have direct access to the local environment to enable measurements of environmental conditions during the flight. The payload is self-powered and exists within an envelope of 1.5 inches x 3 inches x 0.7 inches. The system will protect the payload from inertial forces that exceed the payload's capacity and will isolate the payload from shock and vibration.

      "Creating a system model is an art, placing the quality burden on the human modelers. Moody states, 'there are no generally accepted guidelines for evaluating the quality of conceptual models, and little agreement among experts as to what makes a 'good' model' (Moody, 2005). The responsibility lies with the modeler to strike a balance -communicating system elements clearly for implementation while maintaining simplicity for adequate comprehension. The model must provide valuable data to both the model creator and the model viewer.\n",

      "Several attempts have been made to automatically evaluate diagrams by initially decomposing the models into units, including entities and relationships. These efforts involve employing an automated assessment process, as demonstrated in studies by Ali et al. (2007), Thomas et al. (2008), and Waugh et al. (2004). Although these techniques use quantitative metrics for assessing models, the comparison tool must have a completed solution for reference and relies heavily on the subjectivity of what the expert considers to be correct and complete. Cherfi et. al. defines the metrics for conceptual model quality into four major categories: legibility, expressiveness, simplicity, and correctness. In this study, each category is quantified as a ratio based on specific element types (entities, relations, inheritance links, etc.) (Cherfi et al., 2002). Similarly, the qualitative evaluation of the models discussed in this paper was guided by the following criteria:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 1) Cohesiveness - does the model present a unified description of the system of interest?\n",
      "- 2) Coherence - are the model elements connected in a way that is understandable and logical?\n",

The AI-SME was successful in creating requirements, structural elements (blocks and part properties), and identifying interfaces among the part properties. For brevity, the results are summarized using a representative set of diagrams. AI-SME was used to generate requirements, structure, and interfaces for each of three different prompts. These prompts resulted in differing architectures and requirements, as shown in the following figures. The three prompts are summarized here:\n",
      "\n",
      "- ● Prompt 1: Mission and stakeholder desires were provided as prompts to the AI.\n",
      "- ● Prompt 2: Mission and stakeholder desires, along with the system's name, were used as prompts to the AI.\n",

An examination of the block definition diagram captured in Figure 2 reveals AI-SME model generation mistakes. Specifically, the number of part properties identified on the diagram exceeds the number of actual parts created. This reveals a limitation in GPT's capacity to articulate a complete hierarchical structure. Addressing this challenge could involve a two-step approach: enhancing the precision of prompts given to GPT and implementing corrections during the diagram generation. This two-fold process would ensure that each part property is associated with a corresponding part in the diagram.\n",

Two sets of requirements did identify one safety concern, but safety was not present across all sets.

      "It is important to note that, in contrast to AI-SME, the human modeler has extensive knowledge of the SysML language. The human modeler also has a solid understanding of the systems engineering process and corresponding analyses and methods. AI-SME relies on the unknown experience of GPT.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "As one of the initial endeavors to examine GPT-4's ability to generate SysML conceptual models, this study is a significant advancement in the field of AI assisted systems engineering. The use of generative AI to create SysML diagrams was accomplished through creation of a tool that integrates GPT-4 with enterprise-level SysML modeling software (CATIA Magic). The tool took the form of an MBSE intelligent assistant, AI-SME, capable of rapidly producing requirements diagrams, block definition diagrams, and internal block diagrams. Using AI-SME, a sample set of these diagrams was created for a hypothetical model rocket system while a second set of models was created by a human modeler.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through a comparison of the human and AI generated model sets we found that AI-SME and the human modeler developed comprehensive structural hierarchies that were capable of executing the mission. However, the redundancies and inconsistencies present in the AI-generated models require analysis, review, and revision to ensure coherence and cohesiveness in the description. Additionally, AI-generated models developed highly varied numbers of blocks among iterations and among prompts. This variance would need to be tempered by prudent application of systems engineering principles and the use of good systems architecting principles to create an optimal structural description.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was found that the requirements created by AI-SME were coherent and cohesive but were incomplete and often were a simple recitation of the information included in the prompt. More research is necessary to determine if the completeness of the requirements could be improved by more detailed prompts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interfaces defined by AI-SME were moderately coherent and cohesive, but were not completely defined. Similarly to requirements, more research is needed to determine how to better enable GPT to create interface descriptions that are accurate for the system of interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, AI-SME required 99.6 seconds to create requirements, structural definitions, and interface definitions. This represents a considerable time savings and could offer a distinct advantage to a systems modeling effort. In contrast, the time required for the human modeler to create the same three types of information was around 10 hours. This illustrates the potential for AI-SME to greatly reduce the time required to model a system of interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Especially in the case of requirements and interface development, it is not fair to denounce AI-SME as inadequate compared to a human modeler. The human modeler has extensive knowledge of systems engineering, systems thinking, and the SysML language. The comparison is interesting, however, in that it illustrates the possibility that GPT and AI-SME could evolve to be powerful allies to the human modeler.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite some inaccuracies in the AI generated models, AI-SME offers the potential to greatly improve the systems engineer modeling approach. This is particularly true if the AI-SME is harnessed as an assistant rather than a human modeler replacement. This work demonstrates AI-SME is viable as a modeling assistant to automate primary tasks and increase efficiency by developing prototype architectural descriptions. The human modeler can then easily review and modify the results to ensure cohesiveness, consistency, and completeness by applying a robust and thorough systems engineering analysis.\n",

      "In 2020, the National Defense Industrial Association Systems Engineering Division (NDIA-SED), the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE), and Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC) released a collaborative report highlighting the maturity of MBSE across government, industry, and academia. When surveying 168 enterprise participants, aggregated results show that respondents agree that 'Modeling activities in our organization provide measurable improvements within and across projects.' However, of all the inquiries posed to survey respondents, the strongest disagreement stemmed from the statement 'We have sufficient staffing in our organization to fill all MBSE-related roles' (McDermott et al., 2020). This indicates there are benefits from embracing MBSE, but issues stem from the lack of staffing to support MBSE. The AI-SME accelerates the modeling process, alleviating staffing issues, while improving overall project outcomes and operational efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Future Work\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial intelligence assisted MBSE is still in its infancy. This study illustrated the feasibility of integrating AI with enterprise-level modeling software, yet significant development is required before a tool like the AI-SME achieves complete maturity. First, the tool's capabilities must be expanded to encompass the generation of all 9 SysML diagrams. As the tool's functionality grows, it is imperative to address the evaluation of SysML diagrams. Currently, there is no validated framework for assessing the quality of SysML diagrams, highlighting the crucial need for a framework to understand the value that AI-assisted MBSE can provide.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "- 1. Expand AI-SME capabilities to model all SysML diagrams\n",
      "- 2. Explore how evaluators assess models build by AI vs Human\n",
      "- 3. Develop a framework for assessing SysML diagram quality\n",
      "- 4. Define the strengths and weaknesses of AI-SME so that humans can most effectively employ the tool when creating models\n",
      "- 5. Explore how to train the model in order to generate higher quality output\n",
      "\n",
      "Not surprisingly, many systems engineers have voiced skepticism about the utility of AI for MBSE (Boozingislosing, 2023). This opposition of AI within MBSE can be explained by individual disposition toward AI, situational factors, and learned factors based on performance. Future research should explore how these factors can be addressed to ensure appropriate implementation of AI in systems engineering. Along these lines, further research should investigate how insights into the AI's strengths and weaknesses in systems engineering can be leveraged to ensure human-AI teaming is optimized. A final avenue for future research is on training and model refinement for specific engineering domains enabling higher quality outputs from the GPT model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assessing the quality of AI-generated SysML diagrams remains challenging due to the absence of agreed-upon metrics for a good model. While standards exist across the discipline of engineering, establishing quality benchmarks for conceptual modeling is an ongoing effort and debate. As mentioned previously, clumsy implementation of AI can lead to costly errors and the AI-SME is not immune to errors. Currently, the AI-SME can generate SysML block definition diagrams, internal block diagrams, and requirement diagrams. Additionally, there is potential in exploring GPT's ability to generate more complex and nuanced SysML relationships between elements.\n",
